                    <h3>CHIHUAHUA</h3>
                    <p>The Chihuahua is a balanced. graceful dog of terrier-like demeanor.
                    weighing no more than 6 pounds. The rounded “apple” head is a breed hallmark.
                    The erect ears and full. luminous eyes are acutely expressive. Coats come in
                    many colors and patterns. and can be long or short. The varieties are identical
                    except for coat.Chihuahuas possess loyalty. charm. and big-dog attitude.
                    Even tiny dogs require training. and without it this clever scamp will rule
                    your household like a little Napoleon. Compact and confident. Chihuahuas are
                    ideal city pets. They are too small for roughhousing with kids. and special
                    care must be taken in cold weather. but Chihuahuas are adaptable—as long as
                    they get lots of quality time in their preferred lap. The Chihuahua is a tiny
                    dog with a huge personality. A national symbol of Mexico. these alert and amusing
                    "purse dogs" stand among the oldest breeds of the Americas. with a lineage going
                    back to the ancient kingdoms of pre-Columbian times.</p>
